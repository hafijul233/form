# CONTRIBUTING

- Create a personal [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the project on GitHub.
- [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork) your forked version `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/form.git` on your local machine. 
- Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches#working-with-branches) to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase).
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
  your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
